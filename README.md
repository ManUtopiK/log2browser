Log2browser is a fork of [Cozy-logreader](https://github.com/arthurnn/heartbleed-docker/tree/master/cozy-logreader) hacked for my owns needs.

Configure log files you want to watch in config.js.  
Output can be parsed with [XRegExp](http://xregexp.com/) to render more comprehensible logs.

Just browse http://localhost:9099/ when server.js is started!
